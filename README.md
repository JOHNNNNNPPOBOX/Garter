# Garter
Welcome to Garter, a Google Snake Mod I'm working on. It's meant to eventually be the ultimate mod for everything, but it isn't there just yet.

### How to Set Up:
All you need to do is to paste the code in garter-snake.js into the console. You can also set the script below as a bookmark. Then, when you get into Google Snake, click the bookmark to load the mod.

`javascript:fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukasexists/Garter-GoogleSnake/main/garter-snake.js").then((response) => response.text()).then((responseText) => {eval(responseText)});`

### Features
 - Custom Level Size & Snake Speed: Make your own suffering modes!
 - 6 Custom Snake Speeds: Anxiety, Snail, Zzz, Fly, Car, Bullet
 - 2 Custom Level Sizes: Tiny, Extra Large
